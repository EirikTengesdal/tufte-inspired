# Introduction

Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Statistics and Computer Sciente at Yale University, Edward Tufte is an expert in the presentation of informational. @fig-tufte.

Tufte's style is known for extensive use of sidenotes, integration of graphics with text and typography[^2].

Below we illustrate some of the key features of the Tufte-inspired format. Firstly, we demonstrate the use of fullwidth figures by placing it in a `::: fullwidth [...] :::` block. As can be seen in the example below,  spans the full width of the page.

<!--
::: fullwidth

:::
-->

Note the use of the `fig-cap` chunk option to provide a figure caption. You can adjust the proportions of figures using the `fig-width` and `fig-height` chunk options. These are specified in inches, and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin.

# Usage

## Arbitrary Margin Content

You can include anything in the margin by places the class `.column-margin` on the element. See an example on the right about the first fundamental theorem of calculus.


## Arbitrary Full Width Content

Any content can span to the full width of the page, simply place the element in a `div` and add the class `.column-page-right`. For example, the following code will display its contents as full width.

::: column-page-right
``` md
::: {.column-page-right}
Any _full width_ content here.
:::
```
:::

Now I will also test the footnotes.[^3] Now we continue.

[^3]: Test footnote.

New paragraph here.

Test3.

This is a text with a sidenote.[^4]

[^4]: This is a sidenote without offset.

This is another text with a conditional sidenote with offset. Test.
